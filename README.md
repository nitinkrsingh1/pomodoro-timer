# pomodoro-timer
A pomodoro timer is a special type of timer used to increase productivity. It works something like this:  A pomodoro timer will give you ~25-30 minutes to work, then once you've finished working (thus completing 1 pomodoro), it will give you ~10 minutes to rest, then the timer will repeat the process.
